Harriet Tubman, the great African American abolitionist who rescued hundreds of slaves and led them to freedom was born into slavery as Araminta Harriet Ross.<br> <br>
 <strong>She escaped slavery and made it her lifeâ€™s mission to help other enslaved blacks escape their miserable fate and lead a life of dignity.</strong> <br> <br>
 She had a very tough childhood as she was born to parents who were bonded slaves.

<ul class="two">
<li>Tubman was actually able to buy land in 1859, something not permitted for blacks at the time. 
      She bought the land from a fellow abolitionist that was a safe haven for Tubman and her family.
      She married a veteran of the civil war and also started a family with him soon after.
</li>
<li>      Even though she was a former slave and her family were also slaves, Tubman still gained a lot of fame and notoriety for her involvement in the abolitionist movement. 
      She could have been satisfied with being free herself, but she never settled. She did not want to be free if her family could not join her and this led her to help bring others to freedom. 
      She was not afraid of the danger that this put her in or the target that it made her. 
      Her ultimate goal was always freedom.
</li>
<li>      During the Civil War she was still active in her pursuit of freedom. 
      She even worked as a cook and nurse for the Union Army. 
      She also worked as a spy. 
      This means that she was one of the first women to ever work for the army on an expedition in war. 
      During her expedition, she actually helped to free about 700 more slaves.
</li>
<li>    One of the things that Tubman was most proud of was her pursuit of freedom for enslaved people. 
      She worked to help people escape slavery and one of the people that worked to help get people through the underground railroad. 
      She worked with slaves to help them find the freedom they were looking for. 
      This was very dangerous, but Tubman never let this hold her back. 
      Due to the efforts of Harriet Tubman, hundreds of slaves found freedom. 
      The people that she helped to free were not all family members. 
      To many people, she was one of the most well known conductors of the underground railroad.
</li>
  <li>  Born a slave in a plantation in Dorchester County, Maryland, Harriet Tubman experienced harsh treatment and abuse in her childhood and early life. 
      The violence she suffered caused permanent injuries to her including a head injury due to which she had to endure severe headaches and seizures for the rest of her life. 
      In 1849, when she was in her twenties, Harriet Tubman escaped from Maryland and traveled nearly 90 miles to enter Pennsylvania, where slavery was illegal. 
      She moved by night and was guided by the North Star. The exact route she took is not known.
